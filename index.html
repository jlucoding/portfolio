  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <img src="img/me.jpeg" alt="A photo of Jonathan traveling">
    <p>My name is Jonathan Lu. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a minor in Education. After graduation I worked in the Dept. of Public Social Services as an Eligibility Worker, aka Benefit Specialist. 9 years since graduating from an university, I'm back to school learning to code. If you've noticed, none of my experiences linked together. However, they do so to make me figure out what I really want to do in life.</p>
