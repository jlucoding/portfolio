        <img src="img/me.jpeg" alt="A photo of Jonathan traveling" class="img-fluid">
        <p>My name is <span class="name">Jonathan Lu</span>. I graduated from the <strong><em>University of California,
              Irvine</em></strong> with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a minor in Education. After graduation I
          worked in the <strong>Dept. of Public Social Services</strong> of Los Angeles County as an Eligibility Worker,
          aka Benefit Specialist. 9 years since graduating from the university, I'm back to school learning to code. If
          you've noticed, none of my experiences link together. However, they do so to make me figure out what I really
          want to do in life.</p>

          <p>In this practice, the main objective was to learn how to branch and merge a project. HTML and CSS were used
            to complete this project.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/jlucoding/cupcake-shop.git" target="_blank">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
          <p>In this project, my group decided to use one project throughout the day to refine the webpage as we learn
            to use classes, divs and spans, floats, and box models. Also a README was created for this project. HTML,
            Markdown, and CSS were used to complete this project.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/jlucoding/animal-shelter-website.git" target="_blank">Animal Shelter
              Website</a></li>
          <p>The objective of this project was to incorporate CSS styling learned previously into cascading. HTML and
            CSS were used to complete this project. </p>
